## Movie Night Trivia


## Description
Movie Night Trivia is a trivia game based on 4 different movie genre categories or filmmakers: 
Monty Python, 80s, Cult Classics and Mixed Bag (Mixed Bag is a compilation of all 3 and random questions are chosen).

## Background
It is based on a typical trivia game you may play on a flight, etc. but this is mobile friendly and cuter.

## MVP Goals/Stretch Goals/What's Next
- I reached my MVP Goals but do not have the questions inside of the other 3 categories; however, the functionality is there. 
- I would like to continue to flesh out the questions/answers of the other categories and by possibly adding images from the films and sound effects from the films.
- I would also like to provide another animation at the end to celebrate the winner or coax the loser to play again.

## References
Aside from using the above, I also found some great fonts that capture the films.
